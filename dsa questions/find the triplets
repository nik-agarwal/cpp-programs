Given two integers A and B, the task is to find a triplet (X, Y, Z) such that all of them are divisible by A, exactly one of them is divisible by both A and B, and X + Y = Z.

Example:

Input: A = 5, B = 3
Output: 10 50 60
Explanation: For the triplet (10, 50, 60), all of them are divisible by 5, 60 is divisible by both 5 and 3, and 10 + 50 = 60. Therefore, (10, 50, 60) is valid triplet. Other possible triplets are (5, 25, 30), (5, 15, 20)

Input: A = 7, B = 11
Output: 28 154 182


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    if(b==1){
        cout<<-1;
    }
    else
    cout<<a<<a*b<<a*(b+1);  
    
	return 0;
}
